        <p>
            A laptop is a personal computer that can be easily moved and used in a variety of locations. 
            It is a smaller version of a computer that does the same work as a computer. 
            Laptops are designed to have all of the functionality of a desktop computer, 
            which means they can generally run the same software and open the same types of files.
